# Process Tasks — $ARGUMENTS: path of `tasks.md`

## Procedure (follow strictly)

- Step 0: Check the $ARGUMENTS (`tasks.md`).
- Step 1: Create a new branch (if you are on `main`).
- Step 2: Find an incomplete task.
- Step 3: Divide tasks into PR‑sized chunks.
- Step 4: Process the tasks and commit properly.
- Step 5: Mark the completed task as checked in `tasks.md`.
- Step 6: Continue until the tasks PR is ready (do not create the PR).
