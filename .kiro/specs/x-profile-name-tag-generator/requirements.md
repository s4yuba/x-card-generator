# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates a tool that generates printable name tags from X (Twitter) profile information. The tool takes an X profile URL, extracts user information and profile image, and generates a PDF name tag suitable for printing. The name tag includes the user's display name, username, profile image on the front, and a QR code linking to their profile on the back.

## Requirements

**User Story:** As a user, I want to input an X profile URL and automatically generate a name tag, so that I can quickly create professional name tags for events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user inputs an X profile URL in the format https://x.com/{account_id} THEN the system SHALL automatically extract the username and display name from the profile
2. WHEN the system processes the URL THEN it SHALL retrieve the user's profile image from https://x.com/{account_id}/photo
3. WHEN profile data is successfully retrieved THEN the system SHALL automatically generate the name tag PDF without requiring additional user input

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the name tag to include my profile image, so that people can visually identify me at events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system retrieves a profile image THEN it SHALL download and process the image for name tag use
2. WHEN the profile image is unavailable or fails to load THEN the system SHALL use a default placeholder image
3. WHEN processing the profile image THEN the system SHALL resize and optimize it for name tag display

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want a QR code on the back of my name tag, so that people can easily access my X profile.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating the name tag THEN the system SHALL create a QR code containing the original X profile URL
2. WHEN the QR code is generated THEN it SHALL be sized appropriately for scanning from a reasonable distance
3. WHEN the QR code is placed on the name tag THEN it SHALL be positioned on the back side of the name tag

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive a printable PDF, so that I can print the name tag on standard paper or card stock.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the name tag is generated THEN the system SHALL output a PDF file suitable for printing
2. WHEN the PDF is created THEN it SHALL be formatted for standard paper sizes (A4 or Letter)
3. WHEN the PDF contains the name tag THEN it SHALL include both front and back designs on separate pages or as a foldable layout
4. WHEN the PDF is generated THEN it SHALL maintain high resolution for clear printing of text and images

### Requirement 5

2. WHEN a profile is private or inaccessible THEN the system SHALL inform the user and suggest alternatives
3. WHEN network issues prevent data retrieval THEN the system SHALL provide retry options or fallback behavior
